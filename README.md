Bank Database System - Phase 1

</div>
🚀 Overview
Welcome to Phase 1 of the Bank Database System! This phase is all about laying the groundwork for a robust database that will manage operations across customers, bank employees, branches, accounts, transactions, and loans. We're building this system to be reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain. Let's dive into the architecture and what makes up the backbone of our banking application.

📐 Features
Database Schema Design: We've crafted a comprehensive Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to guide the construction of our database schema. This visual blueprint is critical for understanding how our data will interact and ensuring we build a solid foundation.

Table Creation: Using the ER diagram, we'll create database tables equipped with primary and foreign keys. This ensures data integrity and relationships are accurately represented, paving the way for seamless data management.

Basic Relationships: Our initial setup focuses on establishing clear and efficient relationships among the various entities like customers, accounts, and branches. This setup is designed to mimic real-world banking interactions and provide a seamless flow of data.

🌟 Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your database environment and begin implementing the schema outlined in our ER diagram. Here’s how you can set up your local environment:

Prerequisites
MySQL installed on your local machine. Download MySQL
Basic knowledge of SQL.

📝 Notes
This is only the beginning! Phase 1 focuses on setting up the database. Subsequent phases will introduce more complex features such as transactions, advanced queries, and performance tuning.
Feedback and contributions to the schema or setup instructions are highly welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
